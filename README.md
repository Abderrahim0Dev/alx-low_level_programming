# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains my solutions to ALX's low-level programming assignments.

## Description

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate my understanding of low-level programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and memory allocation.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* gcc compiler

### Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chikhidev/alx-low_level_programming.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alx-low_level_programming`

### Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alx-low_level_programming`
2. Compile the desired program: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <file_name>.c -o <output_file_name>`
3. Run the program: `./<output_file_name>`
